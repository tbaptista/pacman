Pac-Man game clone using the pyafai framework
=============================================


This pac-man clone was created with the purpose of serving as a learning tool
for the Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course from the Department
of Informatics Engineering of the University of Coimbra. It is built on top
of the pyafai framework, a multi-agent framework also built with an educational
purpose.

The main game logic is implemented in pacman.py, and all the ex* files are
example exercises. In these exercises, code is missing that is supposed to be
implemented by students, usually marked by a comment (TODO).
